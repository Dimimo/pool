            We are for the first time playing 2 seasons simultaneously. The following <i>convention</i> is implemented:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Monday League</strong> is <strong>Season 2021/04</strong><br>
            <strong>Tuesday League</strong> is <strong>Season 2021/05</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            First time visitors automatically get to see the newest season (in this case 2021/05). If you choose 2021/04 from the dropdown
            menu, the browser will remember your choice the next time you visit this page.
