        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
            <strong>Monday League</strong> is
            <a href="{{ route('pool.cycle', ['2022/01']) }}" class="text-dark">
                <strong>Season 2022/01</strong>
            </a>
            <br>
            <strong>Wednesday League</strong> is
            <a href="{{ route('pool.cycle', ['2021/11']) }}" class="text-dark">
                <strong>Season 2021/11</strong>
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            First time visitors automatically get to see the newest season (in this case 2021/11). If you choose 2021/10 from the dropdown
            menu, the browser will remember your choice the next time you visit this page.
